00:00 So the example you saw before
00:01 this producer and consumer thing
00:03 maybe it felt like a toy example, an artificial example.
00:06 And you're like, "Well, Michael, you took this
00:08 latency of average of 15 seconds down to 0.25 seconds
00:12 made it 60 times better, but it was fake.
00:15 It wasn't a real thing
00:17 and how about we do some real work
00:19 and actually see if you get anything close to that?"
00:22 Well, we will, we definitely will.
00:24 So it is time to do some real work
00:26 and the example that I chose is web scraping.
00:29 So what we're going to do, we're going to go
00:31 do some web scraping, make a bunch of
00:33 HTTP requests against the server
00:35 download some stuff, run some BeautifulSoup web scraping
00:39 type queries against it, and get a little bit of data out
00:42 and then print that out to the console, okay?
00:45 We're going to request a bunch of pages
00:46 and this is a perfect example for asyncio
00:49 'cause while we're waiting on one server to respond
00:51 we can issue another request
00:53 and another, and another, and another, right?
00:56 Within that hundred milliseconds
00:57 or whatever the response time is
00:59 we could issue many requests to many of our servers
01:02 and really just incredibly amplify the speed
01:05 so that's what up next.
