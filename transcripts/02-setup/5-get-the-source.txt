00:00 Every single thing you see me type in this course
00:02 will be available to you in GitHub.
00:04 Before you go farther, pause the video and go over to
00:07 GitHub.com/talkPython/async-techniques-python-course
00:12 You can also just click the link to this GitHub
00:15 repo in your course details page.
00:18 You want to make sure you get access to this
00:20 and go over there and star
00:21 and consider forking it as well.
00:23 That way you have a copy of exactly
00:25 we're working with during this course.
00:26 I encourage you to play around and write some code
00:29 and try out the ideas from each chapter
00:31 as we get to them.
00:33 Most of the chapters have a starting and
00:35 final version of code.
00:37 So if you wanted to take, say, a serial
00:40 single threaded computational little app
00:42 that we build, and convert it to
00:44 threads and convert it to
00:45 multiprocessing, and things like that
00:47 you'll have a copy over here on GitHub.
00:49 So just be sure to star this, and
00:51 consider forking it. Definitely check it out so
00:53 you have access to it. If you don't do Git
00:56 and that's fine, just click where it says
00:58 clone or download, and
00:59 download a zip, and then you'll have the
01:00 source, as well.
