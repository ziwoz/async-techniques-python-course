00:00 In this course like most of our courses
00:02 I'm going to be using PyCharm.
00:04 Now you don't have to use exactly the same editor.
00:06 You can use Visual Studio Code with a Python plug-in.
00:09 You can use Emacs. You can use Vim.
00:11 Whatever makes you happy.
00:12 But if you want to follow along exactly.
00:15 Then I recommend you use Pycharm.
00:16 Now almost all of this course can be done
00:18 in the Community Edition, the free edition of PyCharm.
00:22 There is one chapter on web development.
00:24 Maybe it's a little bit easier with PyCharm Pro
00:27 but because we're not really working with CSS, JavaScript
00:30 the template, anything like that
00:32 I think you could actually use PyCharm Community Edition
00:34 for the entire course. So if you want to use that
00:38 just visit jetbrains.com/pycharm.
00:41 Get it installed and I'll show you
00:42 how to use it along the way.
00:43 If you want to use something else, like I said, no problem
00:45 use what makes you happy.
00:47 Just be aware this is the one we're using
00:48 so you have to adapt your editor and waverunning code
00:51 to what we have over here.
