00:00 Although I trust you can take the sun example
00:02 and adapt it to the weather example
00:03 let's go ahead and do that together.
00:05 So over here we're going to say we have an async method.
00:09 And again, this right now is a synchronous function.
00:12 Let me just go over here and grab some aiohttp client.
00:17 And we're going to re-implement this again, not request.
00:22 And not response like that but like this.
00:27 And this. Good? One more thing, async.
00:34 Okay, so now this is an async method
00:36 using async with and async await.
00:41 And here, we should be able to go to this function
00:43 and we don't get the data back, we have a coroutine.
00:46 If we await it though, we get the data back.
00:48 Alright, I think that's done it.
00:50 Let's just test the weather as well.
00:54 So there's the sun but if I change that to weather
00:57 yep, also works. So it looks like we've converted from
01:00 an entirely synchronous Flask based API over to Quart
01:04 and what does that take?
01:05 Maybe, maybe 15 minutes, probably less
01:08 with me talking and explaining, poking around.
01:11 If I just put my head down
01:12 that could've been a 10 minute job, easy.
01:15 Granted, pretty toy application
01:17 but not entirely a toy app, right?
01:19 It is calling other services
01:20 it does have some reasonable structure with the blueprints
01:23 and the config files and all that kind of stuff.
01:25 So it's non-trivial
01:27 even if it's somewhat on the small side.
01:29 Hopefully you see this as pretty straight forward
01:31 and pretty easy to do.
