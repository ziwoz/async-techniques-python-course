00:00 So when we talked about the performance and profiling
00:02 and load testing previously, just the previous video
00:06 I said you have to run on an ASGI server.
00:09 WSGI, traditional Web Service Gateway Interface
00:13 that's how Django, Pyramid, Flask, all of them work.
00:16 They're all based on this.
00:18 Basically the underlying web API
00:21 that integrates these frameworks into the server
00:23 those are serial.
00:24 So there's no way to do asynchronous programming
00:27 or execution for those frameworks at all.
00:30 So in order to actually get the scalability
00:32 and to actually execute our code on asyncio event loops
00:37 you have to use what's called as ASGI server.
00:40 An Async Service Gateway Interface
00:43 something to that effect. So you can use Hypercorn.
00:46 Hypercorn comes when you pip install quart
00:48 you get Hypercorn, this is an option.
00:51 It says you don't type run.
00:52 You know, don't like just run this here.
00:55 What you're going to do instead is you type hypercorn
00:58 module name and then app name that you want to run, okay?
01:02 Also lists some others down here, Uvicorn.
01:05 We talked about uvloop based on that, right?
01:08 And some of its capabilities.
01:10 So you can see Hypercorn is pretty awesome.
01:12 I believe it's based on Gunicorn
01:14 much like Uvicorn is as well
01:16 and I honestly don't know enough about them
01:19 to like help you decide between one or the other
01:21 but this one looks like it has more features.
01:23 That seems good. Make sure if you do any load testing
01:27 or you do this in production
01:28 that you run it on an ASGI server
01:31 or you're basically going to get exactly the same
01:33 as what you had with Flask and if that's what you're getting
01:36 you might as well keep the more well-known
01:38 well-tested API, right?
01:40 Be sure to use one of these servers.
