00:00 You saw the design decision
00:01 Flask is not intended to support async
00:04 and currently it doesn't maybe it will at some point.
00:08 So what do you do? Give up?
00:10 No, you can go use this thing called Quart.
00:13 Flask, Quart, Bottle, things like that.
00:15 So Quart is a Python web microframework just like Flask
00:19 it's based on asyncio and it has very good
00:22 compatibility with Flask.
00:24 What does that mean? It means has the same API as Flask
00:27 it means even the extensions you can install
00:29 into Flask are compatible with Quart.
00:32 So if you have a Flask app, chances are
00:34 you can tweak it a tiny bit, make it a Quart app
00:37 and then it becomes asyncio enabled.
00:41 That is our goal, our goal is to take our work in Flask app
00:43 that we saw previously and convert it to Quart
00:47 and that conversion will mean a little bit
00:49 of stuff to change the framework.
00:51 And then, more work to actually reimplement
00:54 our services that call external services
00:57 in asyncio capable ways.
01:00 We already have done that once or twice
01:01 so it's not a big deal but we do have to go through
01:03 those steps to do the conversion.
