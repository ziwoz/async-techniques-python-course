00:00 Our goal is to convert this working Flask app
00:03 into a Quart app, and it turns out
00:06 because of the very high compatibility between the two APIs
00:09 it's not that much work.
00:11 So let's go over here and add
00:13 take out Flask and put Quart.
00:18 We're going to make sure we pip install those requirements.
00:23 Alright, great, we've got a bunch of things installed here.
00:26 So, how do we do this conversion?
00:28 Well, here's the rough rule of thumb.
00:30 You see the word Flask, you convert
00:32 that to the word Quart.
00:33 If it's lower case, it's lower case quart.
00:35 If it's upper case, upper case Quart.
00:37 Alright, so let's try Quart here.
00:38 And we go over here and we say this .Quart.
00:41 Yeah, looking good. Okay, this file is converted.
00:46 That wasn't so painful, was it?
00:48 With these two views, let's go fix this one.
00:50 We're going to import Quart and we're going to say
00:52 Quart blueprint, that's the kind we want.
00:54 And here we're doing a Flask response
00:57 so we're going to do a Quart response.
00:58 Also we have the city API, similarly
01:01 Flask, Quart, Flask, Quart, Flask abort, Quart abort.
01:06 Flask jsonify, Quart jsonify. You guys get it.
01:10 Am I done? Let's try. Ho ho ho, it is working.
01:14 Seems pretty good, let's try this one.
01:18 Yeah, still working.
01:19 That wasn't too hard, what was this?
01:22 A couple of minutes?
01:23 We've converted from Flask to Quart.
01:25 Granted, larger applications, more find and replace
01:28 but not too bad.
