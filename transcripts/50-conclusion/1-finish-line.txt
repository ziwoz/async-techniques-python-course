00:00 Well, how about that you made it to the end
00:02 and there it is, the finish line, you've crossed it.
00:05 You now wield the dark arts of concurrent programming.
00:10 It's great to have a skill of
00:11 I now know how to write concurrent programs
00:13 but I think it's even more important
00:15 to have a wide survey of all of the options
00:18 of concurrent programming and being able to choose
00:21 between this type of solution versus
00:24 that type of solution at the right time.
00:26 And I hope that's what you've gotten out of this course.
00:29 Let's go real quickly and review
00:31 each of the major chapters that we covered
