00:00 Open this course with a quote about what is concurrency
00:03 and what is asynchrony in computer programming
00:05 from Wikipedia, specifically to highlight
00:08 that it's not just about threads.
00:10 It's also about multiprocessing
00:12 but it's also about things like asyncio
00:15 that's cooperative concurrency.
00:17 So remember, we have one main thread of execution
00:20 we have a bunch of different tasks
00:21 and we're going to break those tasks into little tiny slices.
00:25 Here they look kind of coarse grained
00:26 but imagine we're just way zoomed in.
00:28 And we break the task into different pieces
00:31 and we'll do a little bit of one, a little bit of other
00:33 a little bit of another, and we interleave these while
00:37 say the green task maybe is going to go talk to a database
00:39 so while it's talking to the database
00:41 we can run the first part of the pink task.
00:43 We get a response from the database to want to call
00:45 a webservice on the green.
00:46 Well let's go try a little blue, things like that.
00:48 So we're able to come along and just run all of these tasks
00:51 by interweaving them, because mostly what they're doing
00:54 is waiting on some external system, waiting on io.
00:58 So this is the heart of asyncio
01:00 and the async and await keywords in Python.
