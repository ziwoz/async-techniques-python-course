00:00 Threads have been around and available
00:02 in Python for a long time
00:04 and using threads for parallel programming
00:06 is certainly one of the main ways in which we can
00:09 add concurrency to our Python programs.
00:12 Let's quickly look at our landscape here.
00:15 So we're over in this green threads box
00:17 and that generally puts us in the do more at once.
00:21 So threads are very similar to AsyncIO in that sense.
00:25 Because of the Python GIL, the Global Interpreter Lock
00:28 that we spoke about in the Introduction to Async
00:30 Programming in Python chapter
00:32 threads don't really let us leverage the multiple cores
00:35 to do actual concurrent CPU-bound operations.
00:38 Some languages they do, in Python they don't.
00:41 That puts thread concept squarely in the
00:44 do more once category in our little landscape here.
00:48 So we're going to focus on threads
00:50 this is, like I said, it's been around for a long time
00:52 so many different systems are built
00:54 taking advantage of threads.
00:56 And there's still many good use cases for them
00:58 and certainly understanding how they work
01:00 and how to use them in Python is critical
01:03 to having a well-rounded, asynchronous programming tool set.
