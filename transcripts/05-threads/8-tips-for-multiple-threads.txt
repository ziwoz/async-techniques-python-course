00:00 We saw a few nice little techniques
00:01 for working with sets of threads
00:03 more than one thread at a time.
00:05 So let's suppose that we're going to create
00:08 three threads and we want to work with them as a set.
00:10 Basically we want to spin those three off
00:12 and then we're going to start them
00:14 and then wait for them all to finish.
00:15 So we did that in our producer consumer example
00:18 while having a list of threads
00:20 and we create them all
00:21 and just in line like this.
00:22 We could do it in a loop.
00:23 Append if you wanted.
00:24 But in this case
00:25 we didn't need to do that.
00:27 Next we're going to start them all
00:28 using this cool little list comprehension.
00:31 t.start() for t in threads.
00:33 Potentially do some other work
00:35 and then wait for them to finish.
00:37 So t.join() for t in threads.
00:40 Pretty simple right.
