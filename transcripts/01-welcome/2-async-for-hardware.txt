00:00 Here's a graph we're going to come back to
00:01 and analyze at great depth later in the course.
00:05 It came from a presentation by Jeffrey Funk.
00:07 You can see the SlideShare link there
00:09 if you want to go check it out.
00:10 It's actually 172 slides.
00:12 I want to just call your attention to this graph around 2005.
00:16 If you look at, most importantly, the dark blue line
00:20 that is single-threaded performance over time.
00:24 Note, it's going up and up and up
00:25 following Moore's law, that's the top line
00:27 and then it flattens out
00:28 and it actually is trending downward.
00:31 What is going on here?
00:32 Well, look at the black line.
00:34 We have the number of cores
00:35 going from one up to many
00:38 right around 2005 and continuing on today.
00:41 To take full advantage of modern hardware
00:44 you have to target more than one CPU core.
00:48 The only way to target more than one CPU core
00:50 is to do stuff in parallel.
00:52 If we write a regular while loop
00:54 or some sort of computational thing in regular Python
00:57 that is serial and it's only going to run on one core
00:59 and that means it's following that blue downward line.
01:02 But if we can follow the number
01:04 of cores growing, well, we can multiply
01:05 that performance massively, as we'll see.
01:09 One of the reasons you care about asynchronous programming
01:12 is if you have anything computational to do
01:15 that depends on getting done fast
01:17 not like I'm calling a database
01:19 or I'm calling a web service and I'm waiting.
01:20 That's a different type of situation we'll address.
01:23 But no, I have this math problem
01:25 or this data analysis problem
01:26 and I want to do it as fast as possible in modern hardware.
01:29 You're going to see some of the techniques
01:31 that we talk about in this course
01:32 allow us to target the new modern hardware
01:35 with as much concurrency as needed
01:37 to take full advantage of all the cores of that hardware.
01:40 So like I said, we're going to dig way more into this later
01:43 I just want to set the stage that if you have
01:45 anything computational and you want to take full advantage
01:48 of modern hardware, you need asynchronous programming.
