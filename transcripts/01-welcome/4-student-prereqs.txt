00:00 Let's take a moment and just talk really quickly
00:02 about the prerequisites for this course.
00:05 What do we assume you know?
00:06 Well, we basically assume that you know Python.
00:09 This course is kind of intermediate to advanced course
00:13 I would say, it's definitely not a beginner course.
00:15 We run through all sorts of Python constructs
00:17 classes, functions, keyword arguments, things like that
00:21 without really explaining them at all.
00:23 So if you don't know the Python language
00:25 you're going to find this course a little bit tough.
00:27 I recommend you take my Python Jumpstart
00:29 by Building 10 Apps, and then come back
00:32 and pick this course up.
00:33 You don't have to be an absolute expert in Python
00:36 but like I said, if you're brand new to the language
00:39 take a foundational course first
00:40 and then come back and dig in
00:41 to the Asynchronous Programming after that.
