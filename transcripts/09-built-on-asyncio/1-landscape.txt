00:00 In this chapter, we're going to talk about libraries
00:02 that are built on top of async and await.
00:05 And I'm not talking about just libraries like
00:07 uMongo that let you use async in a way with Mongodb
00:11 but libraries that are specifically built as frameworks
00:14 for creating asynchronous programs that themselves
00:18 use things like asyncio and async and await.
00:21 So, there's a bunch of these out there
00:23 we're going to cover a couple of them
00:25 more as an example of a few great libraries you could use
00:29 not an exhaustive list of all of them, of course.
00:33 Now, I could either gray pretty much everything out
00:36 or I could line up almost everything.
00:37 As you'll see, we're going to touch
00:38 on many of the things before.
00:41 So, we're definitely built on top of async
00:43 and that's going to let us do more at once.
00:45 One library were going to work with, unsync
00:47 actually works with multiprocessing threads and asyncio
00:50 but it's primarily an asyncio type of library.
00:53 And trio is built entirely on asyncio.
00:57 With these two libraries, you can both do more at once
01:00 and do them faster.
01:02 But the reason their in this course is because
01:05 they let you do these things more easily.
01:08 They let you coordinate them better
01:10 they put a unifying API on top of them
01:12 they simplify things, stuff like that.
01:15 They both add their own special capabilities
01:18 so it's not like we're doing two takes on the same thing.
01:21 They're actually quite different
01:22 in their goals and what they do.
01:24 I think you find unsync and trio to be excellent
01:26 additions to the core libraries you're already
01:29 familiar with from earlier in this course.
