00:00 The next extra library that we're going to
00:03 look at that builds on asyncio and makes it better
00:06 and easier and simpler is Trio.
00:08 Trio's goal is to produce a production quality, permissively
00:11 licensed async and await native io library for Python.
00:15 So it has a bunch of things for work with networks
00:20 and so on, but it also has really great support for just
00:21 coordinating anything built on top of asyncio itself.
00:25 So where Trio really shines is it tries to focus
00:28 on making coordination around asyncio simpler.
00:32 They want to make it easy to do the best right thing
00:35 with asyncio, so what's interesting is this is a framework
00:38 built entirely from the ground up that integrates
00:40 with async and await, but does not directly use asyncio.
00:45 So like asyncio.get_event_loop, that is not part of this whole
00:51 framework, it's something similar and in parallel to that
00:54 and you actually have to use a bridging library.
00:57 Something called trio-asyncio in order to actually
01:00 use things built on the asyncio event loop.
01:04 I think you'll find Trio an interesting
01:06 library that could work for certain circumstances
01:09 and types of apps you're building.
