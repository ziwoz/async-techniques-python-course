00:00 Let's wrap up this chapter on multiprocessing
00:02 by talking about exchanging data.
00:04 So we've seen that we start the work
00:06 by saying pool.apply_async()
00:08 give it a function, and some arguments.
00:10 That's the first aspect of exchanging data
00:13 so we can pass in these arguments, 0 and 100
00:17 in this example.
00:18 And we're going to capture the results
00:20 and then after the work is done
00:22 after the pool's been joined and closed
00:24 and all that kind of stuff
00:25 we can go to the results and we can even check
00:27 if it were successful
00:28 and then we could call result.get
00:30 and that's going to give whatever the return value of
00:32 from do_math() work.
00:35 And those values that can be exchanged
00:37 they're pretty rich.
00:38 Basically, anything that can be pickled
00:40 which are most things, but not all things Python
00:43 those things can be created and passed in
00:45 or returned from these various functions.
00:48 So we're passing the arguments
00:50 we captured the results and hang onto it
00:53 and then when all the work is done
00:54 we just call get() to receive value from the function
00:57 that we ran in multiprocessing.
