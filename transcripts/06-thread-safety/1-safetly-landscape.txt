00:00 No conversation about threads would be complete
00:02 without discussing the very, very important topic
00:06 of thread safety.
00:08 Once we start working with threads
00:10 we take on a whole new level of responsibility
00:13 and we're going to talk about why that is
00:14 and how we solve those problems
00:16 and how we take responsibility
00:18 for managing our data structures
00:20 and making sure everything is safe
00:21 there's no race conditions
00:22 or otherwise corrupt data in our program.
00:25 But before we get to that
00:26 let's just talk about where we are on our landscape
00:28 in our big Python parallelism and map.
00:31 So again, we're over in this thread section
00:33 and we already talked about why it's in the do one side
00:35 and not the do things faster.
00:36 We saw that previously as an actual demo even.
00:39 When we're working with threads
00:41 we have to be super, super careful about thread safety
00:44 and we're going to talk about that throughout this chapter.
